Bob was searching around the internet just doing normal things like checking his e mail and his social media.
When all of the sudden someone e mails him that they are intrested into him and they wanted to know more about him.
But Bob was smart enough to know that this wasn't a real person because he doesnt even know them and he knew that this was a phising attempt.
It turns out the girl that someone was posing to be was a grown man that was trying to get information from Bob but luckly Bob knew.
